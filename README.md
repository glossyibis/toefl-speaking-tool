I developed TOEFL Independent Speaking Question Practice Tool

Check it out, it's free to use: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1P9UxN_3D4chzsrUy7x5fqPLmqnrbgwvI?usp=sharing

Features:

- Add custom prompts
- Records your voice for feedback
- Converts your recording to text
- Tells you your WPM (words per minute)

It might take some time to load if you have slow connection.

Let me know if you have any questions :) !
